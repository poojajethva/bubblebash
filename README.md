How to Play BubbleBash ?


Protect the fish from bashing the bubbles. Fish can only move up and down. Enjoy!!

This game works best even if no internet available. ( Inspired from Google's Dino Game :) )


Desktop: Use UP and DOWN Arrow keys from your keyboard to move the fish up and down.


Mobile: Use ▲ and ▼ Arrow buttons on the right bottom side of the screen to move the fish up and down.

Use landscape mode for better visibility. You can even add the app in your home screen from the browser for quick access.
